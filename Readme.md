# Regression Model

Example of a regression model from a database that is in a PostgreSQL server. The database is accessed, a given cohort is created and from that cohort we want to predict which patients will have one type of diabetes or another. Kaggle's Dataset Sympuf has been used. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drscarlat/cmssynpuf55m
